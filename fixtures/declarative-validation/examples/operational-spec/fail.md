status: ready

# Objective

Mission control.

# Context / Constraints

The example stays generic. It validates Markdown headings, tables, IDs, list
content, literal text, and links without attaching domain meaning to the core
engine.

# Execution Plan

- MUST Validate profile fixtures locally.
- Record evidence before requesting review.
- Keep the checks deterministic and local-only.

# Risk Register

| ID | Mitigation | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OPS-RISK-1 | Keep examples structural. | tracked |
| OPS-RISK-2 | Keep commands local. | closed |
